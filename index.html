      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        The current redition of Tumunu was started by <strong><a href="https://github.com/dupesnduds">@dupesnduds</a>a></strong>, an ex-IT veteran, as a way to give <strong><a href="https://github.com/synviction/">@synviction</a>a></strong> a meaningful path into cybersecurity after finishing his degree. With no job in hand and limited entry points, the goal was simple: build tools that prove competence and fill the gaps in a resume with something real.
      </p>
        It's not a product pitch or training business:just a focused effort to build tools that demonstrate capability and initiative.

      <h2>The What</h2>
      <p>
        Tumunu is an evolving collection of security and digital forensics tools built under a single brand. The goal is to create real, reliable, auditable software that supports hands-on skill development and real-world workflows. These tools are created as needed. no hype, no roadmap promises. just working code aligned with practical needs.
